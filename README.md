Just a fun little plugin I wrote as an exercise for myself to simulate some bonus drops.

- 5.0% chance to drop a stick from decaying leaves
- 0.1% chance to drop a diamond from mined coal
- 0.3% chance to drop a gold nugget from mined iron ore
- 1.0% chance to drop a cookie from mined diamond ore

That's it. That's all it does.
